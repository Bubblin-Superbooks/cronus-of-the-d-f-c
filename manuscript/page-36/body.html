<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"When?"</p><p>"Two to three days."</p><p>I sat down wearily, and stared at Cronus. The screen was blank. "How did you manage to invent that thing?" I said.</p><p>"I didn't really invent it. I just—discovered it. I was tinkering with a TV set, and I changed some circuits and added a lot of gadgets, just for the hell of it. The pictures I got were darned poor, but they didn't seem to be coming from any known station—or combination of stations, since they kept changing. That was interesting, so I kept working on it. Then one day the screen showed me a big aircar smashup. There were about ten units involved, and I told myself, 'Boy, these Class D pictures are really overdoing it.' About a week later I opened my morning paper, and there was the same smashup on page one. It took a long time to get anybody interested."</p></div> </div>
