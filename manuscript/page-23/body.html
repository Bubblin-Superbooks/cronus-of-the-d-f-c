Something wrong?"</p><p>"Not a thing," I said. "I want some information from her."</p><p>"I dunno when she's home."</p><p>Her next-door neighbor did. I went back to headquarters and picked up the loose ends on the attempt to identify our assailant-to-be. No luck.</p><p>And at six o'clock that evening, I was having a cup of coffee with Miss Stella Emerson.</p><p>She was the sort of person it's always a joy to interview. Alert, understanding, cooperative—none of that petty, temperamental business about invasion of privacy.
