<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A nondescript living room. A female shadow. She threw up her hands and stood transfixed for a horrible moment or two. A male shadow bounded into the pictureâ€”a giant male shadow. She turned to run, and he caught her from behind. His hand moved upward. Something glittered in it, and he brought it down. He struck twice, and the female crumpled to the floor. He whirled, ran toward us, and disappeared. The camera ground on, recording the image of that shapeless shadow on the floor.</p><p>Abruptly the scene changed. A restaurant, with crowded tables and jerkily moving robot-servers. Walker swore softly and turned off the camera.</p><p>"That's all I got before," he said. "If I could come on it from a different angle, maybe we could locate the place."</p><p>"When?" the Captain asked.</p><p>"Seven to twelve days."</p></div> </div>
